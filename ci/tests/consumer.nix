# The engine the apparatus was built to hold accountable, finally held by it: a from-scratch pure
# merge engine compared against the reference module system, over the corpus tier its vocabulary
# admits, at every observable each fixture declares.
#
# ★ WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES AND DOES NOT SAY. It says the candidate agrees with the reference on
# these fixtures at these observables, with the identity control green and seedable in the same run.
# It does NOT say the candidate agrees in general, and it does not close the standing interval about
# the shared grammar — that closes at an instantiation with a real corpus, which is deferred with
# its own criteria. A machinery library's green must never be readable as the cross-implementation
# bar being met.

    #   than discovered later as a weak guard.

    # ★★ `latticeThrows.n` survives because the `throws` kind asserts MUTUAL REFUSAL AND NOT A
    #   SHARED CAUSE. The unseeded arm refuses on the merge conflict the fixture is about; the
    #   seeded arm refuses because the adapter removed the attribute the observable reads. Both
    #   refuse, so the claim holds — and it should, because the kind asserts only that both arms
    #   decline, which is all a `tryEval`-shaped refusal reading can ever establish. Measured here
