# THE FIRST CONSUMER — a pure module-merge engine held against the reference on synthetic fixtures.
#
# ★ THIS IS THE INSTANTIATION THE LIBRARY WAS SPECIFIED FOR, AND IT NEEDS NO DOMAIN CORPUS. The
# candidate is a from-scratch reimplementation of the definition→value fold: a genuinely different
# program, not a re-host of the reference's own body. That is what makes it a candidate in
# McKeeman's sense — "two or more comparable systems", one input, divergence as the signal — rather
# than a second reading of one system.
#
# ★★ THE DEPENDENCY ARROW IS REVERSED HERE, ON PURPOSE AND ON THE PLANE NOBODY PINS. In production
# the consumer pins the instrument and runs the differential in its own CI, so the arrow points
# SUBJECT → INSTRUMENT and the instrument stays ignorant of its subjects. This file reverses it once
# so the repository that specifies the instantiation can demonstrate it, and it does so in `ci/`,
# which no consumer pins — nothing downstream inherits the edge.

  # ── THE CORE VOCABULARY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # ★ THE CANDIDATE DOES NOT PUBLISH THE ORDERING COMBINATORS, AND THE CORPUS SAYS SO RATHER THAN
  # DISCOVERING IT MID-SUITE. Each corpus entry declares the vocabulary TIER it needs; drawing the
  # `core` tier is how a candidate with a smaller surface takes the fixtures it can actually run,
  # instead of aborting on a missing attribute halfway through and leaving a reader to work out
  # which fixture was the problem.

  # ── THE SEAM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # The module-system surface substitution: an implementation supplies its own vocabulary and its
  # own evaluator, and the seam adapts both to the comparison's shape. The adaptation is real work —
  # the two implementations do not agree on their request shape (the candidate's evaluator takes a
  # module list and nothing else) nor on their result shape (the reference's config and option trees
  # carry the module system's own synthetic pseudo-option, the candidate's do not).
  #
  # ★★★ AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE IDENTITY CONTROL ASSERTS HERE: *the adapter that makes the
  # candidate comparable does not itself change the answer **at the projections each fixture
  # declares***. Routing the REFERENCE through it must be invisible there. Without that claim, every
  # green in this file would be a green about the adapter as much as about the candidate, and there
  # would be no way to tell which.
  #
  # ★★ THE SCOPE IS NOT DECORATION — THE UNSCOPED SENTENCE IS MEASURABLY FALSE. The adapter really
  # does change the reference's result: `options._module` is present on the bare reference and
  # absent through the seam. The control is green because NO DECLARED PROJECTION REACHES THAT
  # SURFACE — `at [ "config" … ]` never descends into `options`, and `optionNames` filters the
  # pseudo-option on both sides. So the honest claim is bounded by the projection set, and widening
  # that set is what would put the adapter's own change back in view.
